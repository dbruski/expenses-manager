# Expenses manager

This react app was made to keep track of your expenses and their deadlines. You can group your expenses in categories, and you can see the chart showing how much money on what category have you spent your money.

## To build this app i used: 
- React and React Hooks
- React Router Dom
- Styled Components
- Chart.js
- Material icons
- To avoid having backend I saved state in localstorage
